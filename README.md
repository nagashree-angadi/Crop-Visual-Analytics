# CROP VISUAL ANALYTICS
Dashboard to analyze crop production in different regions across the world.

- Identify the regions which produce certain crop more. These can further be used to identify major sources and exporters.
- Identify the impact of major environmental disaster or economic crisis on crop production
- Identify the major components of soil, which increases the production of crops

## Data
- Data is collected by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
- Crop statistics are recorded for 173 products from 1961 - 2014
- Data are expressed in terms of area harvested, production quantity and yield for each crop each country.
- A Compilation of Global Soil Microbial Biomass Carbon, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus Data from NASA Earth data 

## How to run the program?
- Run python app.py in project root folder
- Go to http://localhost:8000

## Result
- Effect of economic recession in 2008-2009, reduction of some commercial crops there was decline in produce such as Oil crops
- Asia is highest producers of Wheat and Rice accredited to the climatic conditions and natural resources availability 
- In Saudi Arabia production of water intensive crops like wheat, rice reduced over the year and crops that take less water like potato production increased. This could be a strategic decision to reduce Saudi Arabia water crisis 
- South American tropical climate is favorable for growing Sugarcane
